# Vectors
## What is a vector?
### Perspectives:
- Physics student: A Vector is an arrow pointing in anywhere that has the length and which direction its going in. it can be moved around anywhere in the grid.
- Mathematician: A generalized version: it can be anything as long as you can properly and multiply a vector.
- Computer Science student: An ordered list of numbers. (order matters).
## Basic Operations.
### Addition.
- Graphically: put **w**'s tail onto **v**'s head (or the opposite), then **v** + **w** (the sum of **v** and **w**) is a new vector from **v**'s to **w**'s head.
- Numerically: for example **v** = (4, 2) and **w** = (3, 2) **v** + **w** = (4 + 3, 3+2).
  - Generally: (x_1 + x_2, y_1 + y_2).
###  Multiplication.
  - Graphically:
  - Positive Scalars: for example, **2v** would just be **v** twice as long. and something like **1/3v** would be **v** squished into a third of itself.
  - Negative Scalars: for example, **-3v** will flip around the arrow than just scale it by the scalar.
