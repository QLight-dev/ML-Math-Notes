# Conditional Probability
To Calculate the probability for if someone is Obese and likes Chocolate preference we first make a contingency table of the total amount of the people who are obese, likes chooclate, isnt obese, likes chocolate, obese, doesnt like chocolate, and isnt obese and doesnt like chocolate in a table:
|          | Likes Chocolate | Hates Chocolate |
|----------| :---------------| :---------------|
| Is Obese | 8               | 2               |
| Is Not Obese | 4           | 6               |

then we do the formula:
for each element: p=amount/total

|          | Likes Chocolate | Hates Chocolate |
|----------| :---------------| :---------------|
| Is Obese | 8               | 2               |
|          | p = 8/20 = 0.4  | p = 2/20 = 0.1  |
| Is Not Obese | 4           | 6               |
|          | p = 4/20 = 0.2  | p = 6/20 = 0.3  |

so that means there is a 40% percent chance we'll see someone who is obese and likes chocolate.
but lets say we dont care
