 # Bayes' Thereom
 to solve the condition probability without knowing p(likes **c** and is **o**)
which basically means not knowing the value for the numerators in this formula:
p(likes **c** and is **o** | is **o**) = p(likes **c** and is **o**)/p(is **o**)

We can multiply both sides of the top equation by p(is **o**):
p(likes **c** and is **o** | is **o**) x p(is **o**) = p(likes **c** and is **o**)/p(is **o**) x p(is **o**)

the two p(is **o**) cancel each other out, so we remove them
p(likes **c** and is **o** | is **o**) x p(is **o**) = p(likes **c** and is **o**)

now we are left with the probability that someone likes **chocolate** and is **obese** equal to the things on the left side of the equation
